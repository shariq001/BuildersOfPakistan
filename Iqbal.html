        <p><span class="first-words">Allama Muhammad Iqbal </span>is celebrated as one of the greatest thinkers, poets, and visionaries in Pakistan's history. Known as the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan," Iqbal’s ideas and poetry played a major role in inspiring the idea of a separate homeland for Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. His life, thoughts, and dedication laid the foundation for Pakistan's identity and purpose.</p>

        <h1>Early Life and Education</h1>
        <p><span class="first-words">Allama Iqbal </span>was born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot. From a young age, he showed a keen interest in learning and a deep love for poetry. He completed his early education in Sialkot and later attended Government College in Lahore. To further his studies, Iqbal went to England, where he studied at the University of Cambridge and qualified as a barrister. He then completed his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Munich in Germany. His academic journey exposed him to new ideas, which influenced his beliefs and future work.</p>

        <h1>Philosophy and Beliefs</h1>
        <p><span class="first-words">Iqbal</span> believed strongly in the power of self-realization and personal growth. He spoke about “Khudi” (selfhood) and encouraged individuals to develop their own identity and purpose. Iqbal’s philosophy combined Eastern spiritualism with Western ideas of self-development, encouraging people to take control of their destiny. His deep connection with his faith and love for the Muslim community inspired him to think about the future of Muslims in India.</p>

        <h1>Contribution to Pakistan’s Vision</h1>
        <p><span class="first-words">Although </span>he was not directly involved in politics, Iqbal’s vision laid the ideological foundation for Pakistan. In 1930, during a historic address in Allahabad, he spoke about his dream of a separate homeland for Muslims where they could practice their beliefs freely and develop as a nation. This speech marked the beginning of the Pakistan Movement, with Iqbal’s ideas inspiring many leaders, especially Muhammad Ali Jinnah, to work toward this goal.</p>

        <h1>Poet of the East</h1>
        <p><span class="first-words">Iqbal's </span>poetry is known for its beauty, wisdom, and depth. He wrote in Persian and Urdu, capturing the struggles and hopes of Muslims. His poems such as Shikwa and Jawab-e-Shikwa expressed both the challenges faced by Muslims and the potential he saw within them. Because of his powerful words, Iqbal is also called "Shair-e-Mashriq" (The Poet of the East). His poetry motivated people to reflect on themselves and work toward a better future.</p>

        <h1>Passing and Legacy</h1>
        <p><span class="first-words">Allama Iqbal </span>passed away on April 21, 1938, but his ideas lived on. Though he did not live to see the creation of Pakistan, his vision and writings continued to inspire the leaders and people working toward an independent Muslim state. Today, Allama Iqbal is remembered as a philosopher, poet, and the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan." His contributions to the identity and soul of Pakistan remain a source of pride and inspiration for Pakistanis.</p>
